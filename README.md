 # BPL-DREAM 11

Welcome to BPL-DREAM 11, an interactive web application built with React where users can assemble their ultimate cricket team. Users can select players, manage their budget, and view their chosen team, all following the Dream 11 concept with an intuitive UI inspired by Figma.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Player Selection**: 
   - Users can browse a list of available players with detailed information like role, country, and bidding price.
   - A "Choose Player" button allows users to add players to their team while checking for coin limits.
   - Duplicate selections and a maximum player limit (6 players) are validated and handled with notifications.

2. **User Notifications with React-Toastify**: 
   - Smooth user feedback through toast notifications for actions like successful selection, insufficient coins, duplicate selections, and team size limit.

3. **Budget Management**: 
   - The user's initial coin amount is displayed in the Navbar. They can increase it by clicking a "Claim Free Credit" button in the banner, allowing them to afford more players.

4. **Responsive Design**: 
   - Built to provide an excellent user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

5. **Newsletter Subscription & Footer**:
   - Users can subscribe to a newsletter for updates, and a custom footer provides quick links and contact information.
